gdb, valgrind and vim:

In this project I also used GDB and valgrind to find bugs and memory leaks. After becoming more comfortable this project with using smart pointers, 
I found myself running into fewer memory leaks and seg faults, but they did still happen, and these tools helped me solve the problems.

I also used this project as an opportunity to get more comfortable with vim keybindings. Especially since in the PSU
proficiency demo, we cannot use an IDE, but are limited to vim, emacs, nano, or pico.

I've used vim in the past, but I spent some time this project learning how to do the most common things I find myself
doing with any project:
    - Search and replace
    - Find specific strings
    - Copy and pasting entire blocks of code (using visual mode)
    - Opening separate tabs and vim windows
