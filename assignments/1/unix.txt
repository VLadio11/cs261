On Debugging with GDB:

In this project I used the GDB debugger and valgrind quite extensively to find bugs and memory leaks respectively.

I found GDB to be especially helpful, as I'd found myself running into segmentation faults while developing. I was able
to just run the program in GDB, then run the 'backtrace' command to get a stack trace. I found this very useful
in helping figure out where to look for the issue.

I also used GDB to actually step through the code and try to find out where values were being set. I used
breakpoints, played around the the layout views (layout src), and more.

Valgrind was also quite helpful for finding memory leaks. However, because I decided to use the std::shared_ptr, 
I ran into far fewer memory leaks than I would have if using just raw pointers!

I look forward to continuing to explore these tools on future projects.
